**Excel Query Chatbot with AI**
This project is a Streamlit-based application that enables users to upload Excel files, ask natural language queries about the data, and receive actionable insights or visualizations. The chatbot uses Googleâ€™s Generative AI API (Gemini) to interpret queries and generate Python code for data analysis and visualization.

**Features**
For "ExcelChat1.py" excel File Upload: the file and the path have to be set in code.
For "ExcelChat1.py" excel File Upload: Users can upload their Excel files directly via the Streamlit dashboard.
AI-Powered Query Handling: The chatbot interprets natural language queries to process and analyze data.
Data Visualizations: Automatically generates Matplotlib-based visualizations based on user queries.
Dynamic Data Processing: Filters, sorts, or summarizes data as requested.
Downloadable Outputs: Provides options to download processed data or visualizations.
Streamlit Interface: Simple and interactive web interface for seamless user experience.
